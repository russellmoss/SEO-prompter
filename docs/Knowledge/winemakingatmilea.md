# Winemaking at Milea Estate Vineyard

## Overview

Milea Estate Vineyard transforms carefully cultivated grapes into honest expressions of their vintage and place through minimal intervention winemaking that emphasizes the inherent qualities of the grapes.

## General Winemaking Processes

### White Winemaking Process

1. **Harvest** - Grapes picked at optimal ripeness
2. **Destemming and Crushing** - Grapes removed from stems and gently crushed
3. **Pressing** - Quick separation of juice from skins to minimize color/tannin extraction
4. **Fermentation** - In stainless steel tanks or oak barrels
5. **Aging** *(Optional)* - Stainless steel for freshness or oak for complexity
6. **Fining and Filtration** - Clarification and stabilization
7. **Bottling** - Final packaging

### Red Winemaking Process

1. **Harvest** - Grapes harvested at desired ripeness including phenolic development
2. **Destemming and Crushing** - Similar to white grapes
3. **Fermentation and Maceration** - Juice fermented with skins for color/tannin extraction
4. **Cap Management** - Punch-downs or pump-overs to manage floating skin cap
5. **Pressing** - Separation from solids after fermentation
6. **Aging** - Commonly in oak barrels for flavor and structure development
7. **Fining and Filtration** *(Optional)* - Clarification before bottling
8. **Bottling** - Final packaging

### Sparkling Winemaking Methods

#### Traditional Method (Méthode Champenoise)
- Base wine creation
- Bottle fermentation with yeast and sugar (liqueur de tirage)
- Secondary fermentation creates CO2 bubbles
- Aging on lees (autolysis) for complexity and bready notes
- Riddling to collect sediment
- Disgorgement to remove sediment
- Dosage addition for sweetness adjustment

#### Tank Method (Charmat/Prosecco)
- Base wine creation
- Secondary fermentation in pressurized tanks
- Filtration and bottling under pressure
- Produces fresh, fruit-forward wines

## Milea's Winemaking Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Minimal intervention** approach allowing grape qualities to shine
- **Non-dogmatic** - decisions based on optimal outcomes for environment, safety, and quality
- **Vineyard-focused** - exceptional wine begins in the vineyard
- **Quality-driven** - will fine and filter when necessary for optimal expression

### Techniques Used
- Many organic cellar techniques (not certified organic)
- Occasional use of albumin (egg whites) for fining, especially for Bordeaux-style blends
- Focus on showcasing fruit's inherent qualities rather than technical interventions

## Red Winemaking at Milea

### Barrel Program
- **Vessel**: 60-gallon French Oak barrels (25 cases/300 bottles per barrel)
- **Investment**: ~$1,200 per new French oak barrel

### Wine Collections

#### Farmhouse Collection Reds
- **Style**: Approachable, easy-drinking when young
- **Oak Treatment**: 10-15% new French Oak, remainder 1-2 year old barrels
- **Aging Potential**: 5-10 years
- **Target**: "By The Glass" offerings, competition wines

#### Devotion Collection Reds
- **Wines**: Reserve and single-vineyard wines (Vincenza, Sang's, Reserve Cabernet Franc)
- **Oak Treatment**: 25-30% new oak, remainder neutral oak
- **Aging Potential**: Up to 20 years
- **Style**: Fuller-bodied wines for Napa Cabernet/Malbec enthusiasts

##### Devotion Collection Process
- **Reductive winemaking** - minimal oxygen exposure
- **Malolactic fermentation** in barrel (up to 2 months)
- **Barrel topping** every 2 weeks to replace evaporation loss
- Released in "tight" state requiring bottle development

#### Heritage Collection Example
- **Chilled Red Chambourcin**: Tank-fermented, minimal barrel aging
- **Rationale**: Low phenolic grape ideal for chilled red style

### Fermentation Specifications
- **Temperature**: Maximum 85°F (cool fermentation for subtlety)
- **Cap Management**: Punch-downs for extraction, pump-overs for gentler handling

## White Winemaking at Milea

### Tank Fermentation (Aromatic Whites)
- **Varieties**: Grüner Veltliner, Riesling, Vignoles, Vidal Blanc (stainless)
- **Method**: "Slow and low" - glycol-cooled tanks at 55°F
- **Purpose**: Preserve delicate floral and fruit aromas

### Barrel Fermentation

#### Reserve Chardonnay & Vidal Blanc Elevage
- **Oak**: 10% new French oak, tight-grained, 3-5 year seasoned
- **Temperature**: ~70°F for broader mouthfeel and savory profiles

#### HV Vineyards Right Bank Chardonnay
- **Oak**: 100% neutral French oak barrels
- **Techniques**: Lees stirring (bâtonnage) for texture and savory notes
- **Character**: Oak influence from fermentation vessel size, not new wood

## Sparkling Winemaking at Milea

### Proceedo Method (Modified Charmat)
- **Varieties**: Proceedo White and Rosé
- **Process**: 
  - Whole-cluster pressing
  - Cool tank fermentation
  - Charmat tank at 33°F
  - CO2 injection and dissolution (2 weeks)
  - 4 atmospheres pressure
- **Style**: Crisp, clean, refreshing with fresh fruit/floral notes

### HV Vineyards Traditional Method
- **Method**: Full Méthode Champenoise
- **Process**:
  - Early harvest for high acidity
  - Cool fermentation in tanks
  - 6 months aging in neutral oak barrels
  - Bottle fermentation with tirage
  - Minimum 18 months aging en tirage (up to 8 years for "Ode")
  - Gyropalette riddling
  - Disgorgement and dosage
- **Style**: Complex, deep, textural richness from extended lees contact

### Dosage Philosophy
- **Purpose**: Balance acidity, not necessarily add sweetness
- **Brut Standard**: ≤12g/L sugar still tastes dry due to high acidity
